get distributed design working
add better filter metrics to distributed design?
figure out best practices monomer filters
figure out filters per target 
states = (combo of threaded seq, parent , pivot , shift and docked helix) 
for states which pass these filters, do high nstruct design. #TODO, just which
inputs instead?
also try motif grafting into either stapled or closed list into design
for everything that has been designed that passes reasonable filters:
	- if chA length < 167, trim to 155
	- resurface to optimize expression and charge
	- run structure prediction?
	- run interface LDDT
	- probably order as many <= 155aa designs as are reasonable
	- filter down to 96 or 192 seq pools of extremely good designs for eBlocks
