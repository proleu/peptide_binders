# TODO also try motif grafting into either stapled or closed list into design?
for everything that has been designed that passes reasonable filters:
	- if chA length <= 175, trim to 162
	- resurface to optimize expression and charge
	- run structure prediction?
	- run interface LDDT
	- probably order as many <= 162aa designs as are reasonable
	- filter down to 96 or 192 seq pools of extremely good designs for eBlocks
